## A seriese of practices with meta programming in Ruby.

- _metaprogramming example 1:_ Changing a class function by rewritting part or all of the class.
- _metaprogramming example 2:_ Changing the String class by swapping censoring certain words.
- _metaprogramming example 3:_ Using a class, created a method that will create non existing methods at runtime. Creates method after runtime.
- _metaprogramming example 4:_ Define_method creates a method at runtime.  Much like example 3's method_missing.
